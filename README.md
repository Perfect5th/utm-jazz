# UTM Jazz
## A (Hopefully) Not Terrible Turing-Machine-based Music Generator

### Development

#### Pre-requisites
  - You'll want to have [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) installed, but it's not an absolute requirement
    - If you don't want to use nvm, you'll need a version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed (the project uses v10.15)
  - That's it!

After cloning the repository, change directories into it and install the single dependency, [parcel](https://parceljs.org), like so:

    $ cd utm-jazz
    $ npm install

To run the project:

    $ npm run dev

To build for deployment:

    $ npm run build

That's it!
